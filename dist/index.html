    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>I know this isn't part of the resume, but there was no place to add additional comments
      on the application process. I had actually made this resume prior to this a few months ago
      when submitting an application for a new job. At the time, I was using some self-development tools
      to try teach myself HTML and CSS. I did not have a word processing program on my computer at home,
      so I thought I would take the time to use it as practice by creating my Resume using HTML and CSS.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      That is not to say I didn't spend more time or work on improving it and making it better. I included the original copy
      on my Git repository to review the changes. A few of the changes are: I edited the CSS to not target whole elements, removed
      some unnecessary HTML, and made the HTML and CSS more consistent and readable. I know there is much more room for
      improvement, but that is where I know Prime can be extremely valuable to me. I would love the opportunity to attend Prime,
      as I know it would give me the skills needed to start a career I know I would genuinely enjoying doing each day.
