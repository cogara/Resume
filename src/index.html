                      <li>Dress for Success Twin Cities (DFSTC) works to prepare low income women to enter the professional work force by connecting them with volunteers and mentors. The process is time consuming for DFSTC staff to schedule the appointments, call the clients and volunteers, and follow up multiple times. Also, the staff uses large spreadsheets to create manual reports about volunteers and appointments.</li>
                      <li>Our app works to eliminate the time consuming process for DFSTC staff by allowing volunteers and clients to seamlessly choose their own time slots, while giving the staff the visibility to see the few times where they may need to make a few calls to fill empty appointment slots. It also automates the numerous reports that the staff runs each day.</li>

                      <li>Planning for camping trips with groups can be tough to organize and redundant over time. Who is reponsible for what equipment, what equipment does an individual need for oneself, are there any special details, what is the meal plan; these are all examples of questions when planning a group trip.</li>
                      <li>Planventure is an app that allows users to easily create or join trips for groups. It is a collaborative environment that helps users plan efficiently and avoid overpacking. In addition, it can help remove the repetitive nature of creating new packing lists for each trip based on user preferences.</li>
                      <!-- <li>Planning for camping trips with groups can be tough to organize. When packing, space is usually at a premium and it is best to avoid bringing any extra or unneccesary equipment that another person may also be bringing. Communicating specifics can be difficult and overlooked when mixed with day to day conversations. Creating a menu can be intimindating when planning for each meal of each day, while making sure the appropriate amount of food is purchased.</li>
                      <li>Planventure was designed to eliminate the repetitive nature of planning for camping and backpacking trips. It allows users communicate and organize who is responsbile for each individual piece of group equipment listed. It is a collaborative online environment to quickly view the details and stats of the trip, while personalizing a user's own personal preference on a trip by trip basis. Users have the ability to set default equipment that will automatically become part of their packing list without re-entering the same data for each trip. The menu is easily editable and readable at a quick glance. A user can then print the whole details of the trip as a packing check list, only showing the equipment they are responsible for as well as a grocery list.</li> -->
